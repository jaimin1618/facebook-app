            The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal),
            political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections), mass surveillance,[9] psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem,
            and content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.

            as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.
